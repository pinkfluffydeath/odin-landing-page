    <div>Surrounded by tropical rainforest and near the Arenal Volcano, Lake Arenal, rivers and hot springs, this resort provides opportunities for adventure and relaxation. On the banks of the San Carlos River, the resort includes sports fields and facilities, a gymnasium, swimming pool, hot tub, restaurant and bar.</div>
    <div>The conical Arenal is the youngest stratovolcano in Costa Rica and one of its most dramatic. The 1,657-meter volcano experiences continuous eruption activity of water vapor and gases. The last major erruption occurred in 2010. The gorgeous view of this National Park is one of the highlights of any trip to Costa Rica.</div>
